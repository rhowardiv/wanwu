Create and manage a simple AWS Lambda with proxy API Gateway

# requirements
Python 2.7, boto3

# howto
./build_api_gateway.py to start

(not all of the code to make things idempotent is working yet, but after
running this 3 times or so I had the lambda and API gateway up and
running on AWS)

./build_lambda.py to just update lambda code
